# About

This is the final required project for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree.
It introduces testing using the Jasmine Framework, and proves why it is
such an important part of the development process.

# Installation

If you decide that you are interested in seeing the code you can get the files
by running `git clone` in the folder where you would like it to live.

Once the folder is cloned you can open the app by running 'index.html'.

# More Information

There are tests written for future implementation:
- 'Initial Entries have a content snippet' checks to make sure the the snippet is present
under the entry title
- 'Add Feed should have a new feed' checks that when a feed is added, allFeeds.length actually
increases by 1
